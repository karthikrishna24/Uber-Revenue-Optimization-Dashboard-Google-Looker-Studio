## Insights

1. From the KPIs, the Total Revenue, the Net Income(excluding tax, toll fee, and airport fee), the average fare that a passenger should offer for a trip, and the total rides are obtained. So accordingly the trip's fare can be allotted for a trip.

2. From the time series graph, we can observe the peak hours and variations in the flow of customers. So, from this supply of taxies at a particular time can be decided, which in turn increases the rate of customers as well as save money.

3. By using the Heat map with a combination of filters we can obtain the Hotspots of the city and supply more taxis to that location to increase the rate of customers and thus more revenue can be generated.

4. From the table, a higher percentage of customers prefer Credit cards than others. So, It is important to integrate Credit card machines into all the taxis.

5. By using some filters we can obtain the passenger count per car from the Tree map. So a variety of cars can be supplied, like Mini, SUV, sedan, etc. By doing so the cost of investing in cars can be reduced.

6. From the Pie chart the distribution of Vendor can be obtained ( The one who supplies the data). Here, it seems like VeriFone Inc is supplying a high amount of data. So, rather than investing in two Vendors, it's better to invest in one which provides effective data, which in turn saves the revenue of the company.
